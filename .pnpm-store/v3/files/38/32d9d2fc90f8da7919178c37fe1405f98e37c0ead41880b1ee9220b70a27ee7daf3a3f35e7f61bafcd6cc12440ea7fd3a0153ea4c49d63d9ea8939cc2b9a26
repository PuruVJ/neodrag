# Svelte Copy

Ever wanted to copy something to clipboard? Say hello to Svelte Copy âœ¨

[**Demo**](https://svelte-copy.vercel.app/)

# Installing

```sh
npm install svelte-copy -D
```

# Using

Let's make a button that when you click it copies `Hello World` to the clipboard:

```html
<script>
    import { copy } from 'svelte-copy';
</script>

<button use:copy={'Hello World'}>
    Click me!
</button>
```

# Events

There are some custom events you can use on elements that have the copy action:

-   `on:svelte-copy`
    This will fire when text is copied, you have access to the copied text if needed with `event.detail`:

    ```html
    <button
        use:copy={'Hello from alert'}
        on:svelte-copy={(event) => alert(event.detail)}>
        Click to cause alert on copy
    </button>
    ```

-   `on:svelte-copy:error`
    This event will fire if there is an error in copying to clipboard, you have access to the error with `event.detail`:

    ```html
    <button
        use:copy={'Some text'}
        on:svelte-copy:error="{(event) =>
            alert(`There was an error: ${event.detail.message}`)}">
        Click to cause alert on copy
    </button>
    ```

# Custom Triggers

By default, copy action is fired on click event. You can change this behavior by passing an object with the name or names of the events that you want to trigger the copy action.

```html
<button
    use:copy={{ text: 'Hello' , events: ['touchstart', 'mouseenter']}}
    on:svelte-copy={(event) => alert(event.detail)}>
    Move cursor over button or touch button to cause alert on copy
</button>
```
