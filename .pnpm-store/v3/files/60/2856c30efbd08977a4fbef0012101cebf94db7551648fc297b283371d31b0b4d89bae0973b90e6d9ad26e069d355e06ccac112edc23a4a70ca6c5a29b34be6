# Astro Telemetry

This package is used to collect anonymous telemetry data within the Astro CLI. It is enabled by default. Telemetry data does not contain any personal identifying information and can be disabled via:

```shell
astro telemetry disable
```

See the [CLI documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-telemetry) for more options on configuration telemetry.
