Convert between positional (line and column-based) and offsets (range-based)
locations in a [virtual file][vfile].

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-location
```

## Use

```js
import {VFile} from 'vfile'
import {location} from 'vfile-location'

var place = location(new VFile('foo\nbar\nbaz'))

var offset = place.toOffset({line: 3, column: 3}) // => 10
place.toPoint(offset) // => {line: 3, column: 3, offset: 10}
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `place`.
There is no default export.

### `place = location(doc)`

Get transform functions for the given `doc` (`string`) or [`file`][vfile].

Returns an object with [`toOffset`][to-offset] and [`toPoint`][to-point].

### `place.toOffset(point)`

Get the `offset` (`number`) for a line and column-based [`point`][point] in the
bound file.
Returns `-1` when given invalid or out of bounds input.

### `place.toPoint(offset)`

Get the line and column-based [`point`][point] for `offset` in the bound file.
