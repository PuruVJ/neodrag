console.info("[astrojs-service-worker] This is a noop service worker for local development. This ensures that a previously installed service worker is ejected. Your configured service worker will be generated in production builds. If you want to inspect the production service worker locally, you can run `astro build` and then `astro preview`. Alternatively, you can opt into production service worker generation in local development by setting `serviceWorker.enableInDevelopment: true` in your astro.config.mjs. See https://github.com/tatethurston/astrojs-service-worker for configuration options.");
