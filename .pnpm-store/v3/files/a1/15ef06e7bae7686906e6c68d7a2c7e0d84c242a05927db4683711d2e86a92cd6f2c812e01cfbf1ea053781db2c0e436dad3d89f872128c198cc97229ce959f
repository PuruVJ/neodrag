The value of this attribute will be in one of the following categories:\n\n*   **Omitted or a JavaScript MIME type:** For HTML5-compliant browsers this indicates the script is JavaScript. HTML5 specification urges authors to omit the attribute rather than provide a redundant MIME type. In earlier browsers, this identified the scripting language of the embedded or imported (via the `src` attribute) code. JavaScript MIME types are [listed in the specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#JavaScript_types).\n*   **`module`:** For HTML5-compliant browsers the code is treated as a JavaScript module. The processing of the script contents is not affected by the `charset` and `defer` attributes. For information on using `module`, see [ES6 in Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/). Code may behave differently when the `module` keyword is used.\n*   **Any other value:** The embedded content is treated as a data block which won't be processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. The `src` attribute will be ignored.\n\n**Note:** in Firefox you could specify the version of JavaScript contained in a `<script>` element by including a non-standard `version` parameter inside the `type` attribute — for example `type=\"text/javascript;version=1.8\"`. This has been removed in Firefox 59 (see [bug 1428745](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1428745 \"FIXED: Remove support for version parameter from script loader\"))."
