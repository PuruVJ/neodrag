- link the folder of the `vscode-html-languageservice` repo to `vscode/extensions/html-language-features/server` to run VSCode with the latest changes from that folder:
  - cd `vscode-html-languageservice`, `yarn link`
  - cd `vscode/extensions/html-language-features/server`, `yarn link vscode-html-languageservice`
- run VSCode out of source (`vscode/scripts/code.sh|bat`) and open a `.html` file
- in VSCode window that is open on the `vscode-html-languageservice` sources, run command `Debug: Attach to Node process` and pick the `code-oss` process with the `html-language-features` path
