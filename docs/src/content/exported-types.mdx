`DragOptions` is the documented list of all options provided by the component.

`DragAxis` is the type of `axis` option, and is equal to `'both' | 'x' | 'y' | 'none'`.

`DragBounds` is `'parent' | string | Partial<DragBoundsCoords>`, the complete type of `bounds` option.

`DragBoundsCoords` is when you're specifying the `bounds` field using an object, this is the type needed for that.

```ts
export type DragBoundsCoords = {
  /** Number of pixels from left of the window */
  left: number;

  /** Number of pixels from top of the window */
  top: number;

  /** Number of pixels from the right side of window */
  right: number;

  /** Number of pixels from the bottom of the window */
  bottom: number;
};
```
