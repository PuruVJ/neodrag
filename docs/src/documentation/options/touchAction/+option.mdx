<p>{shortDescription}</p>

By default, the "touch-action" style is set to `none` upon initalizing the draggable on an element.

This option allows to change the default to some other value in a number of ways:
1. Simply set to another value for any draggable elements that use this draggable instance.
2. Set to different values based on amount of pixels the element was dragged.
3. Set a callback to assign the property to a different value for a specific element based on any arbitrary logic.
