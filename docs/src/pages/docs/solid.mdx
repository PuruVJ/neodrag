# @neodrag/solid

A lightweight SolidJS directive library to make your elements draggable.

Inspired from the amazing [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable) library, and implements a similar API, but 3x smaller.

# Features

- 🤏 Tiny - Only 1.99KB min+brotli.
- 🐇 Simple - Quite simple to use, and effectively no-config required!
- 🧙‍♀️ Elegant - SolidJS directive, to keep the usage simple, elegant and straightforward.
- 🗃️ Highly customizable - Offers tons of options that you can modify to get different behavior.
- ⚛️ Reactive - Change options passed to it on the fly, it will **just work 🙂**

# Installing

```bash
pnpm add @neodrag/solid

# npm
npm install @neodrag/solid

# yarn
yarn add @neodrag/solid
```

# Usage

Basic usage

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

export const App: Component = () => {
  const { draggable } = createDraggable();

  return <div use:draggable>You can drag me</div>;
};
```

With options

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const { draggable } = createDraggable();

<div use:draggable={{ axis: 'x', grid: [10, 10] }}>I am draggable</div>;
```

Defining options elsewhere with typescript

```tsx
import { createDraggable, type DragOptions } from '@neodrag/solid';

const options: DragOptions = {
  axis: 'y',
  bounds: 'parent',
};

const { draggable } = createDraggable();

<div use:draggable={options}>I am draggable</div>;
```

Reactive options:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const [options, setOptions] = createSignal({
  axis: 'y',
  bounds: 'parent',
});

<div use:draggable={options()}>I am draggable</div>;

// You can update `options` with `setOptions` anytime and it'll change. Neodrag will automatically update to the new options 😉
```

<Options />

# Events

`@neodrag/solid` emits 3 events, `onDrag`, `onDragStart` & `onDragEnd`.
Example:

```tsx
<div
  use:draggable={{
    onDragStart: (data) => console.log('Dragging started', data),
    onDrag: (data) => console.log('Dragging', data),
    onDragEnd: (data) => console.log('Dragging stopped', data),
  }}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

# TypeScript

This library ships with proper TypeScript typings, for the best Developer Experience, whether authoring JS or TS.

To get proper TypeScript typing for the `use:draggable` syntax, add this line to your root `globals.d.ts` file:

```ts
/// <reference types="@neodrag/solid/globals" />
```

Or, add to `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@neodrag/solid/globals"]
  }
}
```

However, these types will only work if you destructure the `draggable` directive as `draggable` only. If you rename it, like this:

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const { draggable: myCustomDraggable } = createDraggable();

<div use:myCustomDraggable>Drag me</div>;
```

It will give an error

```txt
Property 'use:myCustomDraggable' does not exist on type 'HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>'.
```

In that case, you have to manually add to your `globals.d.ts` file this snippet:

```ts
import { DragOptions } from '@neodrag/solid';
import 'solid-js';

declare module 'solid-js' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Directives {
      myCustomDraggable: DragOptions;
    }
  }
}
```

## Types Exported from package

This package exports these types you can use:

```ts
import type {
  DragAxis,
  DragBounds,
  DragBoundsCoords,
  DragOptions,
  DragEventData,
} from '@neodrag/solid';
```

`DragOptions` is the documented list of all options provided by the component.

`DragAxis` is the type of `axis` option, and is equal to `'both' | 'x' | 'y' | 'none'`.

`DragBounds` is `'parent' | string | Partial<DragBoundsCoords>`, the complete type of `bounds` option.

`DragBoundsCoords` is when you're specifying the `bounds` field using an object, this is the type needed for that.

```ts
export type DragBoundsCoords = {
  /** Number of pixels from left of the window */
  left: number;

  /** Number of pixels from top of the window */
  top: number;

  /** Number of pixels from the right side of window */
  right: number;

  /** Number of pixels from the bottom of the window */
  bottom: number;
};
```

```ts
type DragEventData = {
  offsetX: number;
  offsetY: number;
  domRect: DOMRect;
};
```

# Controlled vs Uncontrolled

This is taken straight from React's philosophy(After all, this package is inspired from [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable)).

Uncontrolled means your app doesn't control the dragging of the app. Meaning, the user drags the element, it changes position, and you do something with that action. You yourself don't change position of the element or anything. This is the default behavior of this library.

Controlled means your app, using state variables, changes the position of the element, or in simple terms, programmatically drag the element. You basically set the `position` property to `{ x: 10, y: 50 }`(or any other numbers), and voila! yur now controlling the position of the element programmatically 🥳🥳

OFC, this library doesn't go fully **Controlled**. The user can still drag it around even when `position` is set.

So, when you change `position`, the element position changes. However, when the element is dragged by user interaction, `position` is not changed. This is done intentionally, as two-way data binding here isn't possible and also will lead to unexpected behavior. To keep the `position` variable up to date, use the `onDrag` event to keep your state up to date to the draggable's internal state.

To have it be strictly **Controlled**, meaning it can only be moved programmatically, add the `disabled` option to your draggable element's config

```tsx
<div use:draggable={{ position: { x: 0, y: 10 }, disabled: true }} />
```

Here are a bunch of examples showing controlled behavior 👇

# Future plans

Right now, if you look at the syntax, it looks like this:

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const { draggable } = createDraggable();

<div
  use:draggable={
    {
      /* options */
    }
  }
/>;
```

If you look closely, the `createDraggable` is completely useless. It could've just been:

```tsx
import { draggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

<div
  use:draggable={
    {
      /* options */
    }
  }
/>;
```

So why an extra function? Because `use:draggable`, after compiled, is just treated as a string. This means, the typescript compiler/rollup will just remove the import named `draggable` completely, breaking the whole code. Hence a wrapper function is needed.

In future, if SolidJS introduces a mechanism similar to [Svelte's actions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/actions), I'll be able to get rid of that extra call entirely! So if you find this syntax a little more verbose, bear with me, it might become better :)

## Help needed 🛑

This library lacks something very important: **Automated Tests!**

I'll be straight about this: I don't know how to write tests. I've tried, but not been able to.

So I need your help. If you wish to contribute and can add tests here, it would be great for everyone using this! 🙂. There are already some tests but it could benefit from more test cases
