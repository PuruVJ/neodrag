import Options from '$components/options/Options.astro';

import ExportedTypesMDX from '../../documentation/exported-types.mdx';

## Usage

Basic usage

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

export const App: Component = () => {
  const { draggable } = createDraggable();

  return <div use:draggable>You can drag me</div>;
};
```

With options

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const { draggable } = createDraggable();

<div use:draggable={{ axis: 'x', grid: [10, 10] }}>I am draggable</div>;
```

Defining options elsewhere with typescript

```tsx
import { createDraggable, type DragOptions } from '@neodrag/solid';

const options: DragOptions = {
  axis: 'y',
  bounds: 'parent',
};

const { draggable } = createDraggable();

<div use:draggable={options}>I am draggable</div>;
```

Reactive options:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from 'solid-js';
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const [options, setOptions] = createSignal({
  axis: 'y',
  bounds: 'parent',
});

<div use:draggable={options()}>I am draggable</div>;

// You can update `options` with `setOptions` anytime and it'll change.
// Neodrag will automatically update to the new options ðŸ˜‰
```

## Options

<Options />

## Events

`@neodrag/solid` emits 3 events, `onDrag`, `onDragStart` & `onDragEnd`.
Example:

```jsx
<div
  use:draggable={{
    onDragStart: (data) => console.log('Dragging started', data),
    onDrag: (data) => console.log('Dragging', data),
    onDragEnd: (data) => console.log('Dragging stopped', data),
  }}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

## TypeScript

This library ships with proper TypeScript typings, for the best Developer Experience, whether authoring JS or TS.

However, if you destructure the result of `createDraggable()` to something other than `draggable`, you will get errors.
If you rename it, like this:

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const { draggable: myCustomDraggable } = createDraggable();

<div use:myCustomDraggable>Drag me</div>;
```

It will give an error

```text
Property 'use:myCustomDraggable' does not exist on type 'HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>'.
```

In that case, you have to manually add to your `globals.d.ts` file this snippet:

```ts
import { DragOptions } from '@neodrag/solid';
import 'solid-js';

declare module 'solid-js' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Directives {
      myCustomDraggable: DragOptions;
    }
  }
}
```

<ExportedTypesMDX framework="solid" />

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

This is taken straight from React's philosophy(After all, this package is inspired from [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable)).

Uncontrolled means your app doesn't control the dragging of the app. Meaning, the user drags the element, it changes position, and you do something with that action. You yourself don't change position of the element or anything. This is the default behavior of this library.

Controlled means your app, using state variables, changes the position of the element, or in simple terms, programmatically drag the element. You basically set the `position` property to `{ x: 10, y: 50 }`(or any other numbers), and voila! yur now controlling the position of the element programmatically ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

OFC, this library doesn't go fully **Controlled**. The user can still drag it around even when `position` is set.

So, when you change `position`, the element position changes. However, when the element is dragged by user interaction, `position` is not changed. This is done intentionally, as two-way data binding here isn't possible and also will lead to unexpected behavior. To keep the `position` variable up to date, use the `onDrag` event to keep your state up to date to the draggable's internal state.

To have it be strictly **Controlled**, meaning it can only be moved programmatically, add the `disabled` option to your draggable element's config

```tsx
<div use:draggable={{ position: { x: 0, y: 10 }, disabled: true }} />
```

Here are a bunch of examples showing controlled behavior ðŸ‘‡

## Future plans

Right now, if you look at the syntax, it looks like this:

```tsx
import { createDraggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

const { draggable } = createDraggable();

<div
  use:draggable={
    {
      /* options */
    }
  }
/>;
```

If you look closely, the `createDraggable` is completely useless. It could've just been:

```tsx
import { draggable } from '@neodrag/solid';

<div
  use:draggable={
    {
      /* options */
    }
  }
/>;
```

So why an extra function? Because `use:draggable`, after compiled, is just treated as a string. This means, the typescript compiler/rollup will just remove the import named `draggable` completely, breaking the whole code. Hence a wrapper function is needed.

In future, if SolidJS introduces a mechanism similar to [Svelte's actions](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/actions), I'll be able to get rid of that extra call entirely! So if you find this syntax a little more verbose, bear with me, it might become better :)
