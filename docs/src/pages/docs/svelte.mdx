import ExportedTypesMDX from '../../documentation/exported-types.mdx';

npm install @neodrag/svelte

## Migrating from svelte-drag

svelte-drag is the predecessor of this package. To migrate, follow the [Migration guide](migrating/svelte-drag)

## Usage

Basic usage

```svelte
<script>
  import { draggable } from '@neodrag/svelte';
</script>

<div use:draggable>Hello</div>
```

With options

```svelte
<script>
  import { draggable } from '@neodrag/svelte';
</script>

<div use:draggable={{ axis: 'x', grid: [10, 10] }}>Hello</div>
```

Defining options elsewhere with typescript

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { draggable } from '@neodrag/svelte';
  import type { DragOptions } from '@neodrag/svelte';

  let options: DragOptions = {
    axis: 'y',
    bounds: 'parent',
  };
</script>

<div use:draggable={options}>Hello</div>
```

## Options

<Options />

## Events

`@neodrag/svelte` emits 3 events, `on:neodrag`, `on:neodrag:start` & `on:neodrag:end`. These are all custom events, and can be listened on the node the `use:draggable` is applied to

Example:

```svelte
<div
  use:draggable
  on:neodrag:start={(e) => console.log('Dragging started', e)}
  on:neodrag={(e) => console.log(e.detail)}
  on:neodrag:end={(e) => console.log('Dragging stopped', e)}
>
  Hello
</div>
```

Event signatures:

`on:neodrag:start`: `(e: CustomEvent<DragEventData>) => void`. Provides the initial offset when dragging starts, on the `e.detail` object.

`on:neodrag:`: `(e: CustomEvent<DragEventData>`. Provides how far the element has been dragged from it's original position in `x` and `y` coordinates on the `event.detail` object

`on:neodrag:end`: `(e: CustomEvent<DragEventData>) => void`. No internal state provided to `event.detail`. Provides the final offset when dragging ends, on the `e.detail` object.

### Alternative

If you scroll up, you'll see 3 options, `onDragStart`, `onDrag` and `onDragEnd`. These are basically event handlers that you specify as methods of the options object.

Sometimes it helps to be able to put all your event listeners in one object and merge with that later on. To provide that ease of use, the events-as-objects exist.

How to use events-as-options? The syntax is similar to the custom events one ðŸ‘‡

```svelte
<div
  use:draggable={{
    onDragStart: ({ offsetX, offsetY, rootNode, currentNode }) => {
      // Do something
    },
    onDrag: ({ offsetX, offsetY, rootNode, currentNode }) => {
      // Do something
    },
    onDragEnd: ({ offsetX, offsetY, rootNode, currentNode }) => {
      // Do something
    },
  }}
  class="box"
/>
```

Ultimately, this gives everyone a choice. non-TypeScript users will prefer the `on:neodrag:*` method because it is more idiomatic, and TypeScript users can go with events-as-options way to get better TS experience

> Note: Do not use same event in two different ways. I.E., having `on:neodrag:start` and `onDragStart` at once will have both fire at the time when dragging starts. Use only one at a time.

## TypeScript

This library ships with proper TypeScript typings, for the best Developer Experience, whether authoring JS or TS.

<ExportedTypesMDX framework="svelte" />

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

This is taken straight from React's philosophy(After all, this package is inspired from [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable)).

Uncontrolled means your app doesn't control the dragging of the app. Meaning, the user drags the element, it changes position, and you do something with that action. You yourself don't change position of the element or anything. This is the default behavior of this library.

Controlled means your app, using state variables, changes the position of the element, or in simple terms, programmatically drag the element. You basically set the `position` property to `{ x: 10, y: 50 }`(or any other numbers), and voila! yur now controlling the position of the element programmatically ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

OFC, this library doesn't go fully **Controlled**. The user can still drag it around even when `position` is set.

So, when you change `position`, the element position changes. However, when the element is dragged by user interaction, `position` is not changed. This is done intentionally, as two-way data binding here isn't possible and also will lead to unexpected behavior. To keep the `position` variable up to date, use the `on:neodrag` event to keep your state up to date to the draggable's internal state.

To have it be strictly **Controlled**, meaning it can only be moved programmatically, add the `disabled` option to your draggable element's config

```svelte
<div use:draggable={{ position: { x: 0, y: 10 }, disabled: true }} />
```
