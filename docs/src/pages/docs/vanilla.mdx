import Options from '$components/options/Options.astro';

import ExportedTypesMDX from '../../documentation/exported-types.mdx';

```sh
pnpm add @neodrag/vanilla

# or

bun install @neodrag/vanilla

# or

npm install @neodrag/vanilla
```

## Usage

Basic usage

```tsx
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'));
```

With options

```tsx
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'), {
  axis: 'x',
  grid: [10, 10],
});
```

Defining options elsewhere with typescript

```tsx
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const options: DragOptions = {
  axis: 'y',
  bounds: 'parent',
};

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'), options);
```

Update options:

```ts
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'), {
  axis: 'x',
  grid: [10, 10],
});

// Update the specific options. Will be merged with the existing options.
dragInstance.options.axis = 'y';

// Completely overrides existing options, in this case, the `grid` property is removed
dragInstance.options = {
  axis: 'y',
};
```

> NOTE: dragInstance.options is internally a Proxy, allowing the nice `.options[PROPERTY] = VALUE` syntax. If you wish to read the raw value, use `dragInstance.optionsJSON`.

Using via CDN

For users who prefer not to install the package and instead use it directly in their projects via a CDN, you can include `@neodrag/vanilla` directly in your HTML files. This is particularly useful for quick prototyping or projects where you want to avoid a build step. Hereâ€™s how to include it using different CDNs:

Using Unpkg

Include the library in your HTML using the following `<script>` tag. This will load the latest version of `@neodrag/vanilla` directly from unpkg:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@neodrag/vanilla@latest/dist/umd/index.js"></script>
```

Using jsDelivr

Alternatively, you can use jsDelivr as a CDN to load `@neodrag/vanilla`. Include the following line in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@neodrag/vanilla@latest/dist/umd/index.js"></script>
```

Usage with CDN

After including the library via a CDN, `@neodrag/vanilla` will be available as a global variable `NeoDrag`. Hereâ€™s how you can use it to make an element draggable:

```html
<div id="drag">Drag me!</div>
<script>
  var dragInstance = new NeoDrag.Draggable(document.getElementById('drag'));
</script>
```

This method allows you to use `@neodrag/vanilla` without any build tools or npm installations, directly in your browser.

## Events

`@neodrag/vanilla` emits 3 events, `onDrag`, `onDragStart` & `onDragEnd`.
Example:

```tsx
new Draggable({
  onDragStart: (data) => console.log('Dragging started', data),
  onDrag: (data) => console.log('Dragging', data),
  onDragEnd: (data) => console.log('Dragging stopped', data),
});
```

## TypeScript

This library ships with proper TypeScript typings, for the best Developer Experience, whether authoring JS or TS.

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

This is taken straight from React's philosophy(After all, this package is inspired from [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable)).

Uncontrolled means your app doesn't control the dragging of the app. Meaning, the user drags the element, it changes position, and you do something with that action. You yourself don't change position of the element or anything. This is the default behavior of this library.

Controlled means your app, using state variables, changes the position of the element, or in simple terms, programmatically drag the element. You basically set the `position` property to `{ x: 10, y: 50 }`(or any other numbers), and voila! yur now controlling the position of the element programmatically ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

OFC, this library doesn't go fully **Controlled**. The user can still drag it around even when `position` is set.

So, when you change `position`, the element position changes. However, when the element is dragged by user interaction, `position` is not changed. This is done intentionally, as two-way data binding here isn't possible and also will lead to unexpected behavior. To keep the `position` variable up to date, use the `onDrag` event to keep your state up to date to the draggable's internal state.

To have it be strictly **Controlled**, meaning it can only be moved programmatically, add the `disabled` option to your draggable element's config

```tsx
new Draggable({ position: { x: 0, y: 10 }, disabled: true });
```
