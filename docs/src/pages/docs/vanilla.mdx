import Options from '$components/options/Options.astro';

import ExportedTypesMDX from '../../documentation/exported-types.mdx';

```sh
pnpm add @neodrag/vanilla

# or

bun install @neodrag/vanilla

# or

npm install @neodrag/vanilla
```

## Usage

Basic usage

```tsx
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'));
```

With options

```tsx
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'), {
  axis: 'x',
  grid: [10, 10],
});
```

Defining options elsewhere with typescript

```tsx
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const options: DragOptions = {
  axis: 'y',
  bounds: 'parent',
};

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'), options);
```

Update options:

```ts
import { Draggable } from '@neodrag/vanilla';

const dragInstance = new Draggable(document.querySelector('#drag'), {
  axis: 'x',
  grid: [10, 10],
});

// Update the specific options. Will be merged with the existing options.
dragInstance.updateOptions({
  axis: 'y',
});

// Completely overrides existing options, in this case, the `grid` property is removed
dragInstance.options = {
  axis: 'y',
};
```

## Options

<Options />

## Events

`@neodrag/vanilla` emits 3 events, `onDrag`, `onDragStart` & `onDragEnd`.
Example:

```tsx
new Draggable({
  onDragStart: (data) => console.log('Dragging started', data),
  onDrag: (data) => console.log('Dragging', data),
  onDragEnd: (data) => console.log('Dragging stopped', data),
});
```

## TypeScript

This library ships with proper TypeScript typings, for the best Developer Experience, whether authoring JS or TS.

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

This is taken straight from React's philosophy(After all, this package is inspired from [react-draggable](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-draggable)).

Uncontrolled means your app doesn't control the dragging of the app. Meaning, the user drags the element, it changes position, and you do something with that action. You yourself don't change position of the element or anything. This is the default behavior of this library.

Controlled means your app, using state variables, changes the position of the element, or in simple terms, programmatically drag the element. You basically set the `position` property to `{ x: 10, y: 50 }`(or any other numbers), and voila! yur now controlling the position of the element programmatically ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

OFC, this library doesn't go fully **Controlled**. The user can still drag it around even when `position` is set.

So, when you change `position`, the element position changes. However, when the element is dragged by user interaction, `position` is not changed. This is done intentionally, as two-way data binding here isn't possible and also will lead to unexpected behavior. To keep the `position` variable up to date, use the `onDrag` event to keep your state up to date to the draggable's internal state.

To have it be strictly **Controlled**, meaning it can only be moved programmatically, add the `disabled` option to your draggable element's config

```tsx
new Draggable({ position: { x: 0, y: 10 }, disabled: true });
```
